# CPP-Graph-Library
This library consists of *.h and *.cpp files, most-importantly: Graph.h and Graph.cpp. Including these files will allow the user to instantiate 'Graph' objects to model graph-related problems. Graphs are persistent (ie they can be written to disk as *.txt files for later retrieval through a read-from-file Graph constructor).

No external libraries (eg Boost) were used in this project, except for the C++ Standard Template Library.
